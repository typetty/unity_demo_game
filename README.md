# unity_demo_game
This is a game that I created with C# and Unity to demo it's capabilities.


I learned a lot about a few different things:
<ul>
  <li>Basic programming skills in C#,</li>
  <li>Private and public differences,</li>
  <li>Basic animation in Unity with sprite sheets,</li>
  <li>Understanding of different kinds of variables in C#,</li>
  <li>Basic health management for enemies,</li>
  <li>Using boundaries in Unity for various functions,</li>
  <li>And understanding how to use prefabs to apply settings and scripts to multiple sprites.</li>
</ul>
